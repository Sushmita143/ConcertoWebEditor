## Concerto Model Web Editor 
This is a prototype for the web editor.

### Discussion
There was a discussion regarding the project [here](https://github.com/ankingcodes/ConcertoWebEditor/issues/1)

#### Current status
- This successfully converts any CTO code to a GoJS based class diagram.
- It just has an application state where all the modifications are done. No need for Redux
